          <h4>First Question:</h4>
          <p>
            Are you learning (a) programming language(s) for <strong>PERSONAL</strong> reasons, in order to build things
            for your own personal use? 
          </p>
          <input type="radio" name="q2" value="">
          <p><strong>OR</strong> are you trying to be <strong>MORE PROFESSIONALLY COMPETITIVE</strong> by learning extra "in-demand" languages?</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q2" value="">
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Second Question</h4>
          <p>
            Which do you enjoy more?<br>
            Building awesome devices and machines that may only be impressive to "the initiated" (like a perfectly tuned car engine)?
           </p>
          <input type="radio" name="q3" value="">
          <p><strong>OR</strong> do you prefer things with "wow factor" (as in an awesome car chassis + paint job)?</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q3" value="">
        </div>
                  
        <div>
          <h4>Third Question:</h4>
          <p>
            One of the major formative questions behind the construction of computer languages
            is "how much do I want this language to guess at what I'm trying to do, and do it for me?"<br>
            And the truth is, it can be problematic both ways. For example, take 'Garbage Collection' 
          </p>
          <p>
            Garbage Collection is the term for a language that manages memory for you;
            while this can be extraordinarily helpful (you don't have to think about memory address acquisition
            and release) it can also be equally problematic: you may find that sometimes the language "guesses wrong"
            about when you want to "forget" a variable, which can be difficult to diagnose/work around.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, would you prefer that your language <strong>DOES</strong> try to be your 'personal assistant':</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q1" value="yes">
          <p>Or do you prefer that it <strong>DOES NOT</strong>, and you must assign/manage everything personally/manually?</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q1" value="no">
        </div>
       
        <div>
          <p>Fourth Question: (construction important/not important)</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q4" value="">
          <input type="radio" name="q4" value="">
        </div>
       
        <div>
          <p>Fifth Question: (construction important/not important)</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q5" value="">
          <input type="radio" name="q5" value="">
        </div>
       
        <div>
          <p>Last Question: (construction important/not important)</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q6" value="">
          <input type="radio" name="q6" value="">
