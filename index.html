            <h4>First Question:</h4>
            <p>
              Are you learning (a) programming language(s) for <strong>PERSONAL</strong> reasons, in order to build things
              for your own personal use? 
            </p>
            <input type="radio" name="q1" value="a">
            <p><strong>OR</strong> are you trying to be <strong>MORE PROFESSIONALLY COMPETITIVE</strong> by learning extra "in-demand" languages?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q1" value="b">
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Second Question</h4>
            <p>
              Which do you enjoy more?<br>
              Building awesome devices and machines that may only be impressive to "the initiated" (like a perfectly tuned car engine)?
            </p>
            <input type="radio" name="q2" value="a">
            <p><strong>OR</strong> do you prefer things with "wow factor" (as in an awesome car chasis + paint job)?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q2" value="b">
          </div>
                    
          <div>
            <h4>Third Question:</h4>
            <p>
              One of the major formative questions behind the construction of computer languages
              is "how much do I want this language to guess at what I'm trying to do, and do it for me?"<br>
              And the truth is, it can be problematic both ways. For example, take 'Garbage Collection' 
            </p>
            <p>
              Garbage Collection is the term for a language that manages memory for you;
              while this can be extraordinarily helpful (you don't have to think about memory address acquisition
              and release) it can also be equally problematic: you may find that sometimes the language "guesses wrong"
              about when you want to "forget" a variable, which can be difficult to diagnose/work around.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, would you prefer that your language <strong>DOES</strong> try to be your 'personal assistant':</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a">
            <p>Or do you prefer that it <strong>DOES NOT</strong>, and you must assign/manage everything personally/manually?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b">
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quizpage hidden">
          <div>
            <h4>Fourth Question:</h4>
            <p>
              Learning/Implementation style. We will use furniture as an example for this one.<br>
              Would you prefer: <br><strong>IKEA style</strong> furniture, where you are given exactly the pieces
              and tools you need to build something specific?
            </p>
            <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a">
            <p><strong>OR</strong> do you prefer designing your own furniture, <strong>and then</strong>
              having to figure out how to build it with the tools at your disposal? (Or possibly even build/acquire new tools?)
            </p>          
            <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b">
          </div>
        
          <div>
            <h4>Fifth Question:</h4>
            <p>Imagine you are managing a workshop. Which sounds more orderly?</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the day, every employee makes a copy of every tool and takes it back to their workbench?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a">
            <p>
              <strong>OR</strong> each tool has its place, and employees move from station to station?<br>
              Note: for this question, assume no space conflicts; infinite employees can use the same station at a time.
              </p>
            <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b">
          </div>
        
          <div>
            <h4>Last Question:</h4>
            <p><strong>Flight?</strong></p>
            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="a">
            <p>or <strong>Invisibility</strong>?</p>
            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="b">
          </div>
        
          <button class="btn" type="submit">Suggestions, please.</button>
