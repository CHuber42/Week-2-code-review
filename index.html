        <h1>Hello, and welcome to this programming language suggestor. </h1>
        <h3>Fill out this short survey, and I will suggest to you good programming languages for you to learn.</h3>
        <h4>Please bear in mind that the range of languages this survey will suggest is not comprehensive. Possibilities are:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>

            Third Question:<br>One of the major formative questions behind the construction of computer languages
            is "how much do I want this language to guess at what I'm trying to do, and do it for me?"<br>
            And the truth is, it can be problematic both ways. For example, take 'Garbage Collection' 
          </p>
          <p>
            Garbage Collection is the term for a language that manages memory for you;
            while this can be extraordinarily helpful (you don't have to think about memory address acquisition
            and release) it can also be equally problematic: you may find that sometimes the language "guesses wrong"
            about when you want to "forget" a variable, which can be difficult to diagnose/work around.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, would you prefer that your language DOES try to be your 'personal assistant':</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q1" value="yes">
          <p>Or do you prefer that it DOES NOT, and you must assign/manage everything personally/manually?</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q1" value="no">
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Second Question: <br>
            Are you learning (a) programming language(s) for <strong>personal</strong> reasons, in order to build things
            for your own personal use? 
          </p>
          <input type="radio" name="q2" value="">
          <p>OR are you trying to be <strong>more professionally competitive</strong> by learning extra "in-demand" languages?</p>
          <input type="radio" name="q2" value="">
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <p>First Question: (construction important/not important)</p>

        </div>
       
        <div>
          <p>Fourth Question: (construction important/not important)</p>
